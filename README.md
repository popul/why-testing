# Why unit testing

- angular.js boilerplate
- Use ES6 with babel
- Hot reload for components, templates and css
- Packaging with webpack
- mocha **without browser** `npm test`
- mocha in browser `npm run test:debug`
- mocha in console with watch mode `npm run test:watch`
- mocha with code coverage `npm run test:coverage:open` using `nyc`
- Flux architecture with `ng-redux` (redux) and `redux-saga` for business logic and side effects
- Packaging for production in `dist` folder with `npm run build`
